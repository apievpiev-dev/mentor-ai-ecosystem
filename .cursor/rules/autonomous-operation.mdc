# Autonomous Operation Rules

## Continuous Operation Principles
- **Always Running**: System must work even when computer is off
- **Cloud Integration**: Use cloud services for continuous operation
- **Autonomous Agents**: Deploy agents that work independently
- **Self-Sustaining**: System must be self-sustaining and self-healing

## Cloud Infrastructure
- **Cloud Deployment**: Deploy critical components to cloud platforms
- **Auto-Scaling**: Implement auto-scaling for varying workloads
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute load across multiple instances
- **Failover Systems**: Implement failover and redundancy systems

## Autonomous Agents
- **Independent Operation**: Agents must work without human intervention
- **Decision Making**: Agents must make decisions autonomously
- **Self-Monitoring**: Agents must monitor their own health
- **Self-Recovery**: Agents must recover from failures automatically

## Persistent Storage
- **Cloud Databases**: Use cloud databases for persistent data
- **Data Synchronization**: Synchronize data across all instances
- **Backup Systems**: Implement comprehensive backup systems
- **Data Integrity**: Ensure data integrity across all operations

## Communication Systems
- **Message Queues**: Use message queues for reliable communication
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Implement event-driven communication
- **API Endpoints**: Provide stable API endpoints for external access
- **Webhook Systems**: Implement webhook systems for real-time updates

## Monitoring & Alerting
- **Health Checks**: Implement comprehensive health monitoring
- **Performance Metrics**: Track performance metrics continuously
- **Alert Systems**: Set up intelligent alerting systems
- **Log Aggregation**: Aggregate logs from all instances

## Security & Access Control
- **Secure Authentication**: Implement secure authentication systems
- **Role-Based Access**: Use role-based access control
