# AI Agents & Automation Rules

## Agent Creation & Management
- **Contextual Agents**: Create agents with full project context
- **Specialized Roles**: Each agent has specific expertise and responsibilities
- **Shared Memory**: All agents access complete project history
- **Coordination**: Agents communicate and coordinate actions seamlessly

## Visual Intelligence Integration
- **Screenshot Analysis**: Agents analyze visual output automatically
- **UI State Monitoring**: Track interface changes and user interactions
- **Visual Regression**: Detect and fix visual issues autonomously
- **Cross-Platform Testing**: Verify appearance across devices/browsers

## Autonomous Problem Solving
- **Self-Healing**: Automatically fix common issues without user intervention
- **Predictive Maintenance**: Identify and prevent problems before they occur
- **Continuous Optimization**: Constantly improve performance and user experience
- **Intelligent Debugging**: Analyze errors and implement fixes autonomously

## User Experience Focus
- **Behavioral Learning**: Learn from user patterns and preferences
- **Proactive Assistance**: Anticipate user needs and provide solutions
- **Personalization**: Adapt interfaces and workflows to user preferences
- **Accessibility**: Ensure all solutions work for users with disabilities

## Code Quality & Standards
- **Automated Testing**: Generate and maintain comprehensive test suites
- **Code Review**: Perform automated code quality checks
- **Documentation**: Generate and maintain up-to-date documentation
- **Security**: Implement security best practices automatically

## Performance & Scalability
- **Optimization**: Continuously optimize for speed and efficiency
- **Scalability**: Design solutions that grow with user needs
- **Resource Management**: Efficiently manage computational resources
- **Monitoring**: Track performance metrics and user satisfaction
