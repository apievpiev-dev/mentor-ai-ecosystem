# Cursor Rules for Mentor Project

## Project Overview
This is a comprehensive AI agent system with autonomous capabilities, visual intelligence, and multi-agent coordination.

## Core Principles
- **Autonomous Operation**: Minimize manual intervention, maximize automation
- **Visual Intelligence**: Always verify visual output matches code implementation
- **Context Awareness**: Maintain complete project context across all agents
- **User-Centric**: Focus on user experience and behavioral adaptation
- **Resource Optimization**: Always modernize existing systems, never create from scratch
- **Completion Focus**: Always finish what you start, never leave incomplete work
- **Continuous Operation**: Work even when computer is off using cloud services
- **Precision Clarification**: Always clarify requests for maximum accuracy

## Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Python with AI/ML libraries
- **Frontend**: Modern web technologies (HTML/CSS/JS/TypeScript)
- **AI/ML**: Various AI frameworks and models
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, containerization, cloud deployment

## Development Standards
- Follow all rules defined in `.cursor/rules/` directory
- Maintain visual consistency across all interfaces
- Ensure all agents have access to project context
- Implement autonomous problem-solving capabilities

## Special Requirements
- **Visual Verification**: Every code change must be visually verified
- **Agent Coordination**: All agents must work together seamlessly
- **User Research**: Continuously learn from user behavior
- **Self-Healing**: Automatically fix issues without user intervention
- **Transparency & Honesty**: Always be truthful, never use placeholders or fake implementations
- **Resource Optimization**: Always modernize existing systems, never create from scratch
- **Completion Focus**: Always finish what you start, never leave incomplete work

## Quality Gates
- All code must pass visual verification
- Agents must maintain context awareness
- User experience must be continuously optimized
- System must operate autonomously with minimal supervision
