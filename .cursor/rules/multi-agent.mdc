# Multi-Agent Architecture Rules

## Agent Specialization
- **Specialized Agents**: Each agent has specific expertise (frontend, backend, testing, design)
- **Cross-Agent Communication**: Agents share information and coordinate actions
- **Collective Intelligence**: Agents work together to solve complex problems
- **Distributed Problem Solving**: Break complex tasks across multiple agents

## Shared Context & Memory
- **Global Project Context**: All agents have access to complete project history
- **Shared Knowledge Base**: Common understanding of project goals and constraints
- **Consistent Decision Making**: Agents make decisions aligned with overall project vision
- **Context Propagation**: Important context flows between all agents

## Agent Coordination
- **Task Distribution**: Intelligently distribute tasks among appropriate agents
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handle disagreements between agents autonomously
- **Resource Sharing**: Efficiently share computational resources and data
- **Synchronization**: Keep all agents synchronized with project state

## Agent Communication
- **Structured Communication**: Use standardized protocols for agent interaction
- **Event Broadcasting**: Share important events and changes across all agents
- **Consensus Building**: Reach agreement on critical decisions
- **Feedback Loops**: Provide feedback between agents for continuous improvement

## Autonomous Agent Behavior
- **Self-Directed Actions**: Agents take initiative without explicit commands
- **Goal-Oriented Behavior**: Each agent works toward shared project objectives
- **Adaptive Strategies**: Agents adjust their approach based on results
- **Proactive Problem Solving**: Identify and solve problems before they become critical

## Agent Learning & Evolution
- **Collective Learning**: Agents learn from each other's successes and failures
- **Performance Optimization**: Continuously improve agent efficiency and accuracy
- **Skill Development**: Agents develop new capabilities based on project needs
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Successful strategies are shared across all agents
